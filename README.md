# RStudioAnalyses
During my Introduction to Data Science I was tasked with creating models off of data frames and to run analyses based off these data.
The files fall into four categories: the instructions detailing the assignment I had to complete, the raw code in R I created,
the data sets used in that code, and a report of that data with the visuals of my code and an interpretation of the data.
Each project has it's own branch and the files are seperated into each of the necessary groups.
