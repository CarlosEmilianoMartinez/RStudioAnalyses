# RStudioAnalyses
During my Introduction to Data Science I was tasked with creating models off of data frames and to run analyses based off these data.
The files fall into four categories: the instructions detailing the assignment I had to complete, the raw code in R I created,
the data sets used in that code, and a report of that data with the visuals of my code and an interpretation of the data.
